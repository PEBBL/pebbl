PEBBL is a C++ framework for implementing general parallel
branch-and-bound optimization algorithms, providing a mechanism for
the efficient implementation of a wide range of branch-and-bound
methods on an large variety of parallel computing platforms.
This document describes:
\begin{itemize}
\item The history, goals, and general properties of PEBBL
\item How to download and compile PEBBL
\item PEBBL's special search capabilities, including enumeration,
  early output, and checkpointing
\item PEBBL's ability to enumerate multiple solutions meeting various criteria
\item PEBBL's basic architecture, including its serial and parallel layers
\item The design of the serial layer and the notion of manipulating
  subproblem states
\item The design and capabilities of the parallel layer
\item How to build a simple serial branch-and-bound algorithm using
  PEBBL
\item How to extend a serial implementation into a parallel one
