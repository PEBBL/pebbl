The acro_votd_tarball script can be used to make a distribution
tar file for any acro package for any given date, representing
the state of the repository on that date.

The acro_votd_tarballs script uses the acro_votd_tarball script
to create nightly distribution tar files for every acro project.  It
also maintains the previous night's files and a web page listing
the available VOTDs (version of the day tar files).

The acro_release script takes an Acro release number as an argument
and reads the acro/qa/docs/projectVersions.txt file which lists all
projects released with that Acro version.  Then it
creates all the tar files required for the Acro release, and writes
a web page listing all available release tar files.  The script is
documented in the comment in the script file.

acro_votd_tarballs
==================

This bash script uses the acro_votd_tarball script to create a
nightly snapshot distribution tar file for each acro project.  It 
maintains an html file listing the files available for download.  
A "nightly" and a "previous" are maintained for each acro project.
"votd" means "version of the day".

  Command line options:
    debug     Add this argument if you want the acro source that
              was used to build the distributions to be saved.

  Variables defined in script:
    releaseDir  Set to absolute path of directory that script should run in.
    tarballDir  Set to relative path of directory that tar files should
                be written to.
    modules     List of CVS modules to check out
    projects    Name of acro project associated with each module
    publish     Set to "1" if the project tar file is to
                appear on the Acro download web page, "0" otherwise.
  
  On error:
    If the script is not able to complete for some reason, it will
    print the message:
      Interrupted...
      Reverting to state before starting to build this nightly

    More detailed information will be printed by the acro_votd_tarball
    script which is invoked to create each project's tar file.

acro_votd_tarball
=================

This bash script checks out an acro project as of a specific date.
If the project builds successfully, it creates a distribution tar
file.  If a date is specified, it is included in the tar file name,
otherwise the word "nightly" is included in the name.

  Command line options:
    project-name    The acro project to check out
    yyyymmdd        The date for the code snapshot, defaults to
                    today if no date is provided

  Environment variables:
    SOURCE_SAVE_DIR   If set, sources will be saved to this directory

  Variables defined in script:
    cvsloc          Set to "-d path" if required for cvs checkout command

  On error:
    The script will print an error message if checkout, configure, make,
    or "make dist" failed.  The error message contains the string
    "failed" in it.
