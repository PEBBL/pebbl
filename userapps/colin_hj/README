** COLIN optimizer wrapper example
************************************************************************
**
**	This example illustrates the process of extending COLIN to add
**	a user-defined optimizer.  In this example, this is the 'hooke()'
**	optimizer, which is wrapped with the interfaces::Hooke class.
**
**      Note: the hooke() function is included in the lib3po.a library.
**
**      Note: this example mirrors the interfaces::Hooke solver that is
**      included in the Interfaces library.

0)	build acro with COLIN

1)	make

Now you should have the executable file "colintest"

2)	./colintest --help-solvers

This lists the solvers supported in this executable: hooke and Hooke.

3)	./colintest testfunc.xml

This runs the COLIN Hooke solver!
