Check that the TOPBUILD variable in the Makefile is set to 
the top of your acro build directory, where lib and include are
located.

Make sure the bin directory of TOPBUILD is in your PATH,
because gen_*_app calls setupMappedMILP.  You also need
to have AMPL in your PATH.

You must have the parameter file "ufl.par" in your
current working directory when you run pmedian.  

================== gen_milp_app instructions =============

gen_milp_app creates a pmedian application for a given
ampl model and data file:

../bin/gen_milp_app pmedian.mod pmedian.dat

In pmedian_milp.h:

  In the pmedian::MILP class, uncomment the declarations of:
    serialPrintSolution
    newIncumbentEffect
    printAllStatistics

  In the pmedian::MILPNode class, uncomment the declarations of:
    boundComputation
    updateIncumbent

"make" creates the pmedian application

To run the problem:  pmedian pmedian.mps

================== gen_lazy_app instructions =============

gen_lazy_app is very similar, but it writes code to the
setup() method in pmedian_milp.cpp which creates a .val
file at runtime containing the data in the data file provided
at runtime.  In this way, the generated application can be
run on different datasets (for the same model).

(In gen_milp_app, the .val file is created by AMPL in
gen_milp_app, instead of later on when the application runs.
The .val file is required by PICO to solve the problem.)

make really-clean

../bin/gen_lazy_app {model file} {data file #1}

"make" creates the pmedian application

To run the problem:  pmedian {model file} {data file #2}

The pmedian application was created with GeneralSP.mod in mind, 
If you look at boundComputation in pmedian_extras.cpp, you'll 
see it assumes that GoalBound is indexed by (ns, total), and that 
numEvents is indexed by mc.

The model file should be the model used to build pmedian.  The
data file can be different, but needs to be data for the model
that built pmedian.

==========================================================

"make clean" removes built objects and executables

"make really-clean" 
  removes everything that "clean" removes, plus all the 
  gen_milp_app'd files, plus any files written by pmedian
