Acro 2.0: Project acro-pebbl
============================

Acro integrates a rich variety of optimization libraries and solvers
that have been developed for large-scale engineering and scientific
applications. Acro was developed to facilitate the design, development,
integration and support of optimization software libraries. Thus, Acro
includes both individual optimization solvers as well as optimization
frameworks that provide abstract interfaces for flexible interoperability
of solver components. Furthermore, many solvers included in Acro can
exploit parallel computing resources to solve optimization problems
more quickly.

See the Acro home page for further details about the capabilities that
are integrated into Acro:  http://software.sandia.gov/Acro
