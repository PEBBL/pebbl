Defining a PEBBL application with team but not tree parallelism
===============================================================

You will need two classes, one derived from teamBranching (for
problem-instance-wide data) and operations, and one for subproblems (we'll
call this the "team-aware" subproblem class).

Your teamBranching-derived class should derive from, using "virtual public",
   o  The branching-derived class of the serial version of your application, 
      if you have one
   o  teamBranching

If you have a serial application, your subproblem class should derive from the
serial applications subproblem class, using "virtual public".  Otherwise it
may simply derive from branchSub.  You should have a "forward" declaration
(just a declaration of the existence of the class, not a definition) of this
class before your branching class.  

Instances of your team-aware subproblem class will need a pointer back the
teamBranching-derived problem class (called tkGlobal in the example).  You
need to be careful to set this pointer when creating new instances of this
class in memory.

The mpiComm object teamBranching::teamComm holds the communicator for the
local processor's team.

The method teamBranching::iAmHead() returns true on MPI processes that head up
teams, and false on the minions.

The method teamBranching::iAmMinion() is just the opposite of iAmHead(), true
on minions and false on the head processor.

The method teamBranching::getHeadRank() returns the rank of the head within
the team.  This rank is always 0 in the current implementation.

The counter teamBranching::teamMessageCount may be used to count the number of
messages received by each processor.  The teamBranching::reset() method zeroes
this counter but does not call any other reset methods.

The constructor for your teamBranching-derived class, should take an mpiComm
object "comm_" as an argument and call invoke the constructor
teamBranching(comm_).

The teamBranching-derived class should have a reset() method that invokes the
reset methods of both base classes.

Your branching class must define a teamOrganize() method.  It will be called
once teamComm is established.  This method should be used to make sure that
all processors in the team have any problem data etc. they will need during
the search.

If you employ parallel bounding, 

	1.  Define a method minionBound() in your branching class.  It will be
	    called on all minions whenever a bounding operation is
	    initiated.  It should receive any necessary information describing the
	    subproblem from the team head, and then cooperate in computing the
	    bound.

	2.  Have your application subproblem class' boundComputation() routine
	    call alertBound() in your application branching class, then send any
	    necessary subproblem information to rest of the team, then cooperate
	    in computing the bound.  The bound value is returned on the head
	    processor only.

If you employ parallelism when separating subproblems,

	1.  Define a method minionSplit() in your branching class.  It will be
	    called on all minions whenever a subproblem separation operation is
	    initiated.  It should receive any necessary information describing the
	    subproblem from the team head, and then cooperate in separating the
	    subproblem.

	2.  Have your application subproblem class' splitComputation() routine
	    call alertSeparate() in your application branching class, then send
	    any necessary subproblem information to rest of the team, then
	    cooperate in computing the bound.  The number of children is returned
	    on the head processor only.

If you employ parallelism when creating child subproblems,

	1.  Define a method minionMakeChild() in your branching class.  It will be
	    called on all minions whenever a make-child operation is initiated.
	    It should receive any necessary information describing the subproblem
	    from the team head, and then cooperate in creating the child.

	2.  Have your application subproblem class' splitComputation() routine
	    call alertMakeChild() in your application branching class, then send any
	    necessary subproblem information to rest of the team, then cooperate
	    in computing creating the child.

Whether or not you use parallelism in creating child subproblems, your
subproblem class should override your serial one to create children that are
team-aware.  Otherwise, only the root problem of the search will be
team-aware, and the minions will be unused for all subproblem operations after
the root.

In your teamBranching-derived class, make sure to override the method
blankSub() so that it makes a team-aware blank subproblem.  


Defining a Two-Way Parallel PEBBL Application
=============================================

You will need two classes, one derived from parallelTeamBranching, and one for
subproblems.  We'll call this subproblem class "your "parallel-team-aware".

Your branching class should be derived, using "virtual public", from the following

  o  Your parallelBranching-derived application class, if you have one
  o  parallelTeamBranching
  o  Your teamBranching-derived application class, if you have one.

If you have version of the application that uses parallel search but not
teams, then your subproblem class should derive from it (using "virtual
public").  Otherwise it should derive (using "virtual public") from
parallelBranchSub.  If desired, it may also derive (using "virtual public")
from your team-aware subproblem class.

In the parallelTeamBranching-derived class, the member teamComm is the
communicator for the team.  The member passedComm is the communicator within
which PEBBL is running (often MPI_COMM_WORLD, but not necessarily), and the
communicator searchComm consists only of the team heads.

You should override the method blankParallelSub() to create an empty
instance of your parallel-team-aware subproblem class.

You should derive a teamOrganize() method, for the same purpose as for
team-only parallelism.  It will be called in all processors at the outset of
the search process.  If you have a team-parallelism-only version of
teamOrganize(), it is possible to just invoke that method.

The constructor for your parallelTeamBranching-derived class should take a
mpiComm object "comm_" as an argument; this is the communicator within which
the entire computation will run, often equal to MPI_COMM_WORLD.  This
communicator should be passed to constructors of the base classes.

The parallelTeamBranching-derived class should have a reset() method that
invokes the reset methods of parallelTeamBranching and its application base
classes.  On head processors, it should register a solution object (this
process is described in existing PEBBL user guide).

The parallelTeamBranching-derived class should have a "setup" method with
arguments (int& argc and char**& argv).  This method should invoke
parallelTeamBranching::setup with the same arguments.

If you employ parallel bounding, 

	1.  Define a method minionBound() in your parallelTeamBranching-derived
	    class.  It will be called on each minion in a team when a bounding
	    operation is initiated.  It should receive any necessary information
	    describing the subproblem from the team head, and then cooperate in
	    computing the bound.

	2.  Have your application subproblem class' boundComputation() routine
	    call alertBound() in your application branching class, then send any
	    necessary subproblem information to rest of the team, then cooperate
	    in computing the bound.  The bound value is returned on the head
	    processor only.

If you employ parallelism when separating subproblems,

	1.  Define a method minionSplit() in your branching class.  It will be
	    called on all minions in a team when a subproblem separation operation
	    is initiated.  It should receive any necessary information describing
	    the subproblem from the team head, and then cooperate in separating
	    the subproblem.

	2.  Have your application subproblem class' splitComputation() routine
	    call alertSeparate() in your application branching class, then send
	    any necessary subproblem information to rest of the team, then
	    cooperate in computing the bound.  The number of children is returned
	    on the head processor only.

If you employ parallelism when creating child subproblems,

	1.  Define a method minionMakeChild() in your branching class.  It will be
	    called on all minions in a team when a make-child operation is
	    initiated.  It should receive any necessary information describing the
	    subproblem from the team head, and then cooperate in creating the child.

	2.  Have your application subproblem class' splitComputation() routine
	    call alertMakeChild() in your application branching class, then send any
	    necessary subproblem information to rest of the team, then cooperate
	    in computing creating the child.

You may define a method rampUpSetup() in your parallelTeamBranching-derived
class.  This method will be called on all processors when ramp-up starts.  If,
for example you wanted to use a different processor organization for
calculating bounds etc. during ramp-up, this method gives you a chance to do
any necessary setup operations.

The usual parallelBranching predicate rampingUp() will be true when the
ramp-up phase is happening, and otherwise false.

You may define a method rampUpCleanUp() in your parallelTeamBranching-derived
class.  This method will be called on all processors when ramp-up ends.

For disambiguation reasons with in the inheritance hierarchy, you need to
define a printSolution method (arguments const char* header, const char*
footer, std::ostream& outStream).  This method should write a human-readable
version of the incumbent (*incumbent) solution to outStream.  It is acceptable
to just invoke the printSolution method of the search-parallelism-only base
class, if you have one.
