Software Overview</a></h2>
Acro integrates a variety of optimization software packages, including libraries developed at Sandia National Laboratories as well as publicly available third-party libraries. The goal of this integration is to provide a single framework that includes a wide range of optimization methods.<h3><a class="anchor" name="Acro">
Capabilities</a></h3>
Three classes of optimizers are well-represented in Acro:<p>
<ol>
<li>
branch-and-bound methods for integer programming<p>
</li>
<li>
heuristic global optimization methods<p>
</li>
<li>
derivative free local optimization methods<p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="PackagesIP">
Integer Programming</a></h4>
The <b>PICO</b> package defines an object-oriented scalable library for branch-and-bound. In particular, <b>PICO</b> includes a well-developed parallel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solver. <b>PICO</b> depends on <b>UTILIB</b> for many basic data structures and system utilities. Additionally, <b>PICO</b> uses the <b>COIN</b> interface library to encapsulate linear programming solvers. Two publicly available linear programming solvers are integrated into Acro: <b>SOPLEX</b> and <b>CLP</b> (which is included in <b>COIN</b>). The <b>mpPCx</b> parallel linear programming solver is also being developed at Sandia (this is currently not part of Acro).<p>
<b>PICO</b> has been integrated with the <b>GLPK</b> package to support a public domain interface to AMPL integer programming problems. <b>PICO</b> has also been integrated with the <b>AMPL</b> package, which includes the AMPL routines for setting up an AMPL solver.<h4><a class="anchor" name="PackagesGlobal">
Global Optimization</a></h4>
The <b>COLIN</b> package defines a general-purpose interface for optimization solvers. Although many C++ optimization software libraries have been developed, these designs invariably incorporate specific features that facilitate the development and application of the author's algorithms. By contrast, COLIN is intended to provide a generic interface for optimizers that is simple to use and which can encapsulate the basic algorithmic interface of a wide range of general-purpose optimizers. As such, COLIN can be used as 'middle-ware' to facilitate the interface of an optimizer to (a) other optimizers to form hybrid solution strategies and (b) to generic user-interfaces like AMPL or Excel, for which well-defined APIs exist.<p>
The <b>Coliny</b> package defines a variety optimizers using COLIN. In particular, <b>Coliny</b> includes global optimization heuristics like multi-start local search, evolutionary algorithms and DIRECT. Additionally, <b>Coliny</b> includes COLIN interfaces to several other global optimization solvers, including a Lipshitzian solver defined using <b>PICO</b>. The <b>3po</b> package includes COLIN interfaces for a variety of other publicly available optimizers.<h4><a class="anchor" name="PackagesDS">
Derivative Free Optimization</a></h4>
Derivative free optimizers perform local optimization on continuous search domains without the aid of gradients or other derivative information. The <b>Coliny</b> solver includes several derivative free methods, and in particular a variety of pattern search methods. The <b>APPSPACK</b> package defines a parallel pattern search method that exploits a novel asynchronous parallel search.<h3><a class="anchor" name="PackagesApplications">
End-User Applications</a></h3>
The principal goal of Acro is to provide support of optimization libraries. However, there are several end-user applications that can be build within Acro. <ol>
<li>
<b>PICO</b> - a solver for mixed-integer linear programming problems. <b>PICO</b> can be use with AMPL, or with user-input files in standard formats (LP, MPS, etc).<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>coliny</b> - a solver for derivative-free and heuristic global optimization. <b>coliny</b> is principally indended for use with AMPL.<p>
</li>
</ol>
Documentation for the use of these solvers is currently being developed.<h3><a class="anchor" name="PackagesOverview">
Overview of Acro Packages</a></h3>
Acro is organized around a set of closely related software packages. 
The following figure illustrates the dependencies between the Acro
packages.  The dashed lines indicate packages and dependencies that are
currently being developed.

<p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>3po</b> - A library of third party optimizers that are publicly available.<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>CMO</b> - An example of the use of the MW software for parallel master-worker. This is not a core Acro package, and thus it will be reconstituted shortly.<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>COIN</b> - A subset of the COIN optimization repository that includes linear and integer programming interfaces for a variety of third-party software projects. This package uses the Acro configure/makefile's, since COIN does not have a sufficiently flexible configure/build process. See <a href="http://www.coin-or.org">http://www.coin-or.org</a> for further information on this software.<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>SOPLEX</b> - The SOPLEX linear programming library. SOPLEX contains an implementation of the revised simplex algorithm. It features primal and dual solving routines for linear programs and is implemented as a C++ class library that can be used with other programs. See <a href="http://www.zib.de/Optimization/Software/Soplex/">http://www.zib.de/Optimization/Software/Soplex/</a> for further information on this software.<p>

<li>
<b>ampl</b> - This package includes C files provided by AMPL to setup solvers that can be used by AMPL. In particular, this package provides the ability to read the AMPL *.nl file format.<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>appspack</b> - An asyncronous parallel pattern search method developed at Sandia National Laboratories. See <a href="http://software.sandia.gov/appspack/">http://software.sandia.gov/appspack/</a> for further information on this software.<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>colin</b> - A general-purpose C++ optimization interface developed at Sandia National Laboratories. This library provides a middle-ware layer for optimizers that facilitates the use of hybrid optimizers, as well as optimizers applied to novel, user-defined search domains.<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>coliny</b> - Coliny is a collection of C++ optimizers that are derived directly from the COLIN interface. This library includes methods such as pattern search, evolutionary algorithms, multistart local search and DIRECT. Coliny is a revision of the older SGOPT library, which is now deprecated.<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>glpk</b> - The GNU linear programming toolkit. GLPK is intended for solving large-scale linear programming (LP), mixed integer programming (MIP), and other related problems. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html</a> for further information on this software.<p>
</li>
<li>
<b>pico</b> - PICO defines a flexible branch-and-bound engine that uses an object-oriented model to allow it to be easily adapted to new applications. A novel feature of PICO is its ability to scale up parallel branch-and-bound to thousands of processors. PICO also includes solvers for mixed-integer linear programming.<p>
