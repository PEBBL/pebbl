Standard UNIX Installation</a></h3>
After the Acro software has been downloaded, it must be configured for building on specific hosts for specific target platforms. Installation on UNIX systems is performed by the following steps: <ol>
<li>
If you have an archive, unpack it as follows <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
    gunzip acro-$VERSION.tar.gz    # uncompress the archive
    tar xf acro-$VERSION.tar       # unpack it
</pre></div><p>
</li>
<li>
Move into the <b>acro</b> directory and run the <b>configure</b> script. <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
    cd acro
    ./configure
    make
</pre></div>This will configure the software for your machine and compile the Acro library (see Section <a class="el" href="configurationAppendix.html#configurationAppendix">Configuration</a> for more details concerning configuration options and the details of the configuration process). After building Acro, the Makefile scripts will create links to package header directories in the directory <b>acro/include</b>, and links to all package libraries are included in <b>acro/lib</b>. Note that the makefiles in Acro may not be portable to all <b>make</b> commands. However, they do work with the GNU <b>gmake</b> command. </li>
</ol>
<p>
You can remove object files, libraries, and executables by typing <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
    make clean
</pre></div>If you wish to re-configure your Acro source from scratch or re-generate all custom makefiles, type <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
    make distclean
</pre></div>This will remove all symbolic links, custom makefiles, and <b>config.status</b> files. This will require a re-configure of the system and is usually done in preparation for updating source in the CVS repository or creating tape archives for distribution.<h3><a class="anchor" name="AcroInstall">
Custom UNIX Installation</a></h3>
Acro can also be built with the following custom configure/build process <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
    cd acro
    ./setup configure build
</pre></div>This custom configure/build process overcomes a common problem with the standard configure/build process: it can create a voluminous output that is difficult to follow and which can mask the fact that there errors have occured. This is a particular issue for large projects like Acro, which has many independent packages that may fail to configure or build.<p>
The <b>setup</b> command performs the following actions <ol>
<li>
Pipe the configuration output into acro/test/config.out and generate a test/config.xml summary file<p>
</li>
<li>
Pipe the build output into acro/test/build.out and generate a test/build.xml summary file (this includes builds of Acro executables and test executables) </li>
</ol>
The XML files generated in the acro/test director provide a quick reference to confirm that the software was configured and built properly. The use of <b>setup</b> can be extended to include configuration options, and to perform tests. For example the following configures using MPI and performs fast smoke tests of various Acro packages: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
    cd acro
    ./setup configure --with-mpi  build  smoke
</pre></div><h3><a class="anchor" name="documentionInstall">
Setup Documentation</a></h3>
The main Acro makefile includes several targets for generating documentation. This documentation is generated with the <b>doxygen</b> utility, so documentation can be generated in several formats. The command <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
    make html
</pre></div>creates HTML documentation, and the command <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
    make pdf
</pre></div>creates documentation in a single PDF file. This later command requires the use of <b>latex</b>, <b>dvips</b> and <b>ghostscript</b> packages. </BODY>
