This document provides a user's guide for the Acro software library.
The Acro Project is an effort to facilitate the design, development,
integration and support of optimization software libraries.  The goal
of the Acro Project is to develop (parallel) optimization solvers and
libraries using object-oriented software frameworks that facilitate the
application of these solvers to large-scale engineering and scientific
applications.  Thus Acro includes both individual optimization solvers
as well as optimization frameworks that provide abstract interfaces for
flexible interoperability of solver components.  Acro has been written
to support optimizers that are broadly useful for DOE's engineering and
scientific applications.  In particular, many solvers included in Acro
can exploit parallel computing resources to solve optimization problems
more quickly.
